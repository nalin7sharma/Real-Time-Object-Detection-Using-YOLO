# Image-Based-Object-Detection
This project builds a model to detect, classify, and count tiny objects in images, with segmentation as an advanced feature. Using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and deep learning architectures like CNN, YOLO, and R-CNN, the model is trained and evaluated using precision, recall, and mAP metrics.
